##React Projects Repository

This repository contains two React projects that showcase fundamental React concepts and UI development skills:

Anecdote Generator - A simple application that generates random anecdotes using React components and state management.

University Website Home Page - A static home page for a university website built with React, demonstrating layout design and basic styling.

These projects aim to strengthen React fundamentals, including component-based architecture, props, and state handling.
